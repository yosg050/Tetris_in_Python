his project is an implementation of the classic Tetris game in Python, replicating the traditional gameplay with all the essential elements. The development was carried out using the Pygame library, and the code is written in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style.

## General Description
The code implements the game logic and includes:
- **Game Board:** Definition of the play area with boundaries and game-over conditions.
- **Tetris Shapes:** Representation, rotation, and fitting into valid positions.
- **Collision Management:** Prevention of illegal moves.
- **Line Clearing:** Removal of full lines and updating of the game.
- **User Interface:** An interactive graphical display.

## Key Features
- **Pygame:** Developed using the Pygame library for creating graphical interfaces and real-time gameplay.
- **OOP:** Written in an object-oriented approach, enabling modularity and easy organization.
- **Game Logic:** Implementation of basic rules, including game-over conditions, game speed management, and increasing difficulty.
- **Graphics and Interactivity:** Creation of an engaging and intuitive gameplay experience that emulates the classic game.

This project demonstrates the use of Python to create simple yet enjoyable games, with a focus on modularity and interactivity.
